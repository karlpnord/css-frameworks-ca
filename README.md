Connectify is a fictional social media app, where user's can post content about everything in their life (sort of like twitter).
But here there is no max characters on the posts, and the users can add an image to the post if they want.
It's possible to react to everyones post, and comment if they like.
You can also update your own profile (profile picture and banner) and you can see how many follows your profile, sadly it is now possible to follow/unfollow profiles yet.
